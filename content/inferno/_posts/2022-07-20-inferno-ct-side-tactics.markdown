## A setups

### 3 person A setup

If you think they’re going to go mid, you can do this 3 person A setup.
* 1 person gets boosted **on the roof** and watches short and mid
    * <details><summary>On the roof</summary><img src="/assets/images/cs-images/inferno/inferno_position_ct_on_the_roof.png" alt="On the roof"></details>
* 1 person sits **under the roof** (quad) and watches this angle
    * <details><summary>Under the roof</summary><img src="/assets/images/cs-gifs/inferno/inferno_position_under_under_the_roof.gif" alt="Under the roof"></details>
* 1 person sits **on the barrel** at short and watches apts
    * <details><summary>On the barrel</summary><img src="/assets/images/cs-gifs/inferno/inferno_position_under_under_the_roof.gif" alt="On the barrel"></details>

### Contest mid take

* Throw a molotov here to **slow the mid push** and have a teammate throw a flash so you can peek out when the molly fades
    * <details><summary>Slow the mid push</summary><img src="/assets/images/cs-gifs/inferno/inferno_molly_counter_push_short.gif" alt="Counter push short"></details>
* Your teammate will throw a **support flash short** from pit to flash your teammate out short
	* <details><summary>Support flash short</summary><img src="/assets/images/cs-gifs/inferno/inferno_flash_support_short.gif" alt="Support flash short"></details>

### Aggressive AWPing short

* **Aggressively AWPing short** is a good way to mix it up on CT side. Have a teammate molly short after you take your first shot and fall back.
	* <details><summary>Aggressive AWP short</summary><img src="/assets/images/cs-gifs/inferno/inferno_position_awp_short.gif" alt="Aggressive AWP short"></details>

### Defending A site

* Have a player stationed in pit <!-- TODO: add some images for this -->
* And have another person on A site <!-- TODO: add some images for this -->

## B setups

### Take banana control

* 1 person - Every round you can **smoke deep banana** and **molly off the back right corner**. With this util and your teammate flashing for you (throwing the following flash in this section) you can take control of banana and force the T’s to retake it.
    * <details><summary>Smoke deep banana</summary><img src="/assets/images/cs-gifs/inferno/inferno_smoke_deep_banana.gif" alt="Smoke deep banana"></details>
    * <details><summary>Molly back right corner</summary><img src="/assets/images/cs-gifs/inferno/inferno_molly_deep_banana.gif" alt="Molly deep banana"></details>
* 1 person - Another player can throw two of this support flash (**support flash banana from CT corner**) to push the T’s back and allow the other player to take banana control at the start of the round
    * <details><summary>Support flash banana from CT corner</summary><img src="/assets/images/cs-gifs/inferno/inferno_flash_support_banana_from_ct_corner.gif" alt="Support flash banana from CT corner"></details>

### Passive hold banana

* Same as above but you don’t get aggressive banana, you sit back and force the T’s to retake banana (they don’t know that you’re not pushed up and that they don’t have to retake it, they’re smoked off)
* And one person can peek the corner while the other person throws this **support flash from coffin**
    * <details><summary>Support flash banana from coffin</summary><img src="/assets/images/cs-gifs/inferno/inferno_flash_support_banana_from_coffin.gif" alt="Support flash banana from coffin"></details> 

### Delay the B execute

* Throw this smoke as they are executing B to **delay the push**. Ideally, you want to throw this as late in the round as possible.
